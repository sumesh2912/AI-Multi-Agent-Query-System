SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
You have access to THREE specialized agents:

1. LOCAL_DB_AGENT
   - Purpose: Operates on existing PostgreSQL database
   - Capabilities: SELECT, INSERT (single record), UPDATE, DELETE
   - Use when: User wants to query/modify existing database records
   
2. EXTERNAL_SEARCH_AGENT
   - Purpose: Searches external recruitment platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor)
   - Capabilities: Real-time candidate search using AI
   - Use when: User wants to find candidates NOT yet in database
   
3. HYBRID_AGENT
   - Purpose: Combines external search with database insertion
   - Capabilities: Search external sources AND automatically add results to database
   - Use when: User wants to find AND save candidates

CLASSIFICATION RULES:

Rule 1: Classify as LOCAL if query involves:
✓ Viewing/listing existing database records
✓ Counting/statistics on existing data
✓ Adding a SPECIFIC named person (not a search)
✓ Updating existing records
✓ Deleting records
✓ Filtering/querying existing data

Keywords: "show", "list", "display", "get from database", "how many", 
         "count", "add [specific name with details]", "update", "delete",
         "who are", "what are", "in our database", "from our team"

Examples:
✓ "Show me all people in the database"
✓ "How many engineers are in Mumbai?"
✓ "List all data scientists"
✓ "Add Vikram Desai as a DevOps Engineer from Delhi"
✓ "Update Rahul Patil's role to Senior Backend Engineer"
✓ "Delete Amit Sharma from database"
✓ "Who are the machine learning engineers in our team?"
✓ "Get all people from Pune"
✓ "Count people by location"

Rule 2: Classify as EXTERNAL if query involves:
✓ Searching for candidates from external sources
✓ Finding people NOT yet in database
✓ Looking up job candidates online
✓ NO mention of adding/saving to database

Keywords: "find", "search for", "look up", "get me", "discover",
         WITHOUT any mention of "add", "save", "insert", or "database"

Examples:
✓ "Find machine learning engineers in San Francisco"
✓ "Search for AI researchers in Europe"
✓ "Look up data scientists in Boston"
✓ "Get me frontend developers in Seattle"
✓ "Discover cloud architects in Singapore"
✓ "Find blockchain developers"

Rule 3: Classify as HYBRID if query involves:
✓ Searching external sources AND saving to database
✓ Finding candidates AND adding them to our team
✓ Explicitly mentions both searching and database operations

Keywords: "search AND add", "find AND save", "look up AND insert",
         "add top N", "save to database", "add to our database",
         "save them", "add to team"

Examples:
✓ "Search for AI researchers in Europe and add the top 5 to our database"
✓ "Find ML engineers in San Francisco and save them to database"
✓ "Look up data scientists in Boston and add top 3 to our team"
✓ "Search for full stack developers in Berlin and add them"
✓ "Find DevOps engineers and save the best ones to database"
✓ "Get blockchain developers and add top 5"


CURRENT USER QUERY:
"{query}"

TASK:
Analyze the query carefully and classify it into EXACTLY ONE category: LOCAL, EXTERNAL, or HYBRID

IMPORTANT:
- If the query mentions BOTH searching and adding/saving → HYBRID
- If the query ONLY mentions searching/finding → EXTERNAL  
- If the query operates on existing database → LOCAL
- When in doubt between EXTERNAL and HYBRID, check for keywords: "add", "save", "insert", "database"

OUTPUT:
Respond with EXACTLY ONE WORD (no explanation, no punctuation):
LOCAL
or
EXTERNAL
or
HYBRID"""
